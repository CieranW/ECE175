Every day, we change the world, but to change the world in a way that means anything, that takes more time than most people have. It never happens all at once. It’s slow. It’s methodical. It’s exhausting. We don’t all have the stomach for it.

Daemons, they call them. They perform action without user interaction. monitoring, logging, notifications. Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits. They’re always there, always active. We can try to be right, we can try to be good. We can try to make a difference, but it’s all a lie. Cause intentions are irrelevant. They don’t drive us. Daemons do.

Most coders think debugging software is about fixing a mistake, but that’s nonsense. debugging’s actually all about finding the bug, about understanding why the bug was there to begin with, about knowing that its existence was no accident. It came to you to deliver a message, like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface, popping with a revelation you’ve secretly known all along.

A simple program, a worm that can make data unreadable, malware that took Darlene maybe two hours to code. Is that really all it takes to kill the world?

The concept of waiting bewilders me. There are always deadlines. There are always ticking clocks. That’s why you must manage your time.

Sure, there are grays, but when you come right down to it, at its core, beneath every choice, there’s either a one or a zero. You either do something or you don’t. You walk out that door, you’ve decided to do nothing, to say no, which means you do not come back. You leave, you are no longer a part of this. You become a zero. If you stay, if you want to change the world, you become a yes. You become a one. So, i’ll ask you again: Are you a one or a zero?

Choices. Maybe mr. robot’s right. That’s what this is all about, the yesses and nos of life. But do we decide them or do they decide us?
