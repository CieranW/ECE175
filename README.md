# Repository for ECE175 - Programming I for Engineers

ECE 175 is a introductory programming course designed specifically for engineers. It utilizes C to teach basic programming concepts, best practices, and preliminary algorithms. This is often the first programming course that students at the university take.

This repository in particular was my very first experience with GitHub and the state of the repository conveys that level of experience. It is messy, unorganized, and has little to no indication of what was done when or used for what. I've thought about rearranging it, but it was so long ago that I can't recall what I was doing.

With that in mind, I've opted to keep the repository in its current state as a reminder of what I used to do, and what not to do. Sentimental reasons and a taste of the past.
